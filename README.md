# osu! like circle clicking prototype

Trying to create osu in rust with bevy.

I'm tinkering with the [renet](https://github.com/lucaspoffo/renet) crate in order to provide multiplayer capabilities


# Usage

- Start the server :
```sh
cargo run -- server
```

- Start a new client :
```sh
cargo run -- client 
```

The server can accept 2 clients at most.


# Goals

Make a very basic prototype where 2 players can play a circle clicking game.
I'm not sure how far this project will go.

I'm not trying to recreate osu! so I probably won't bother creating slider nor importing osu! maps
